# Fitness/Workout Planner App
This app is a place to organize your workout schedule on a calendar based on muscle groups. 

- Automatic reminders that are created with the days you planned your workouts and custom reminders that can be added. 

- A recommended page,  which is filled with workouts and tips from web scraping fitness sources. They can be sorted by muscle groups categories and once the user clicks it, it goes to the website for more information. 

- Social page for the sharing of fitness topics, workouts guides, food plans, tips, etc. (Since users aren't quite working yet, itâ€™s just your own posts).

- BMI and Macro calculator. They are both for helping the user calculate the right amount of food intake and to reach their fitness goals.
